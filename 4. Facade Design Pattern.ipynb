    "## Facade Design Pattern \n",
    "\n",
    "- Facade pattern hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client using which the client can access the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As the name suggests, it means the `face of the building`. The people walking past the road can only see this glass face of the building. They do not know anything about it, the wiring, the pipes and other complexities. It hides all the complexities of the building and displays a friendly face.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another good example can be the startup process of a computer. When a computer starts up, it involves the work of cpu, memory, hard drive, etc. To make it easy to use for users, we can add a facade which wrap the complexity of the task, and provide one simple interface instead.\n",
